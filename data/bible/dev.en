This then is the message which we have heard of him , and declare unto you , that God is light , and in him is no darkness at all .
If we say that we have fellowship with him , and walk in darkness , we lie , and do not the truth .
But if we walk in the light , as he is in the light , we have fellowship one with another , and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin .
If we say that we have no sin , we deceive ourselves , and the truth is not in us .
If we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins , and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
If we say that we have not sinned , we make him a liar , and his word is not in us .
My little children , these things write I unto you , that ye sin not . And if any man sin , we have an advocate with the Father , Jesus Christ the righteous .
And he is the propitiation for our sins : and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world .
And hereby we do know that we know him , if we keep his commandments .
He that saith , I know him , and keepeth not his commandments , is a liar , and the truth is not in him .
But whoso keepeth his word , in him verily is the love of God perfected : hereby know we that we are in him .
He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk , even as he walked .
Brethren , I write no new commandment unto you , but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning . The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning .
Again , a new commandment I write unto you , which thing is true in him and in you : because the darkness is past , and the true light now shineth .
He that saith he is in the light , and hateth his brother , is in darkness even until now .
He that loveth his brother abideth in the light , and there is none occasion of stumbling in him .
But he that hateth his brother is in darkness , and walketh in darkness , and knoweth not whither he goeth , because that darkness hath blinded his eyes .
I write unto you , little children , because your sins are forgiven you for his name ' s sake .
I write unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I write unto you , young men , because ye have overcome the wicked one . I write unto you , little children , because ye have known the Father .
I have written unto you , fathers , because ye have known him that is from the beginning . I have written unto you , young men , because ye are strong , and the word of God abideth in you , and ye have overcome the wicked one .
Love not the world , neither the things that are in the world . If any man love the world , the love of the Father is not in him .
For all that is in the world , the lust of the flesh , and the lust of the eyes , and the pride of life , is not of the Father , but is of the world .
And the world passeth away , and the lust thereof : but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever .
Little children , it is the last time : and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come , even now are there many antichrists ; whereby we know that it is the last time .
They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would no doubt have continued with us : but they went out , that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us .
But ye have an unction from the Holy One , and ye know all things .
I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth , but because ye know it , and that no lie is of the truth .
Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ ? He is antichrist , that denieth the Father and the Son .
Whosoever denieth the Son , the same hath not the Father : ( but ) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also .
Let that therefore abide in you , which ye have heard from the beginning . If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you , ye also shall continue in the Son , and in the Father .
And this is the promise that he hath promised us , even eternal life .
These things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you .
But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you , and ye need not that any man teach you : but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things , and is truth , and is no lie , and even as it hath taught you , ye shall abide in him .
And now , little children , abide in him ; that , when he shall appear , we may have confidence , and not be ashamed before him at his coming .
If ye know that he is righteous , ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him .
Behold , what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us , that we should be called the sons of God : therefore the world knoweth us not , because it knew him not .
Beloved , now are we the sons of God , and it doth not yet appear what we shall be : but we know that , when he shall appear , we shall be like him ; for we shall see him as he is .
And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself , even as he is pure .
Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law : for sin is the transgression of the law .
And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins ; and in him is no sin .
Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not : whosoever sinneth hath not seen him , neither known him .
Little children , let no man deceive you : he that doeth righteousness is righteous , even as he is righteous .
He that committeth sin is of the devil ; for the devil sinneth from the beginning . For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that he might destroy the works of the devil .
Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin ; for his seed remaineth in him : and he cannot sin , because he is born of God .
In this the children of God are manifest , and the children of the devil : whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God , neither he that loveth not his brother .
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning , that we should love one another .
Not as Cain , who was of that wicked one , and slew his brother . And wherefore slew he him ? Because his own works were evil , and his brother ' s righteous .
Marvel not , my brethren , if the world hate you .
We know that we have passed from death unto life , because we love the brethren . He that loveth not his brother abideth in death .
Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer : and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him .
Hereby perceive we the love of God , because he laid down his life for us : and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren .
But whoso hath this world ' s good , and seeth his brother have need , and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him , how dwelleth the love of God in him ?
My little children , let us not love in word , neither in tongue ; but in deed and in truth .
And hereby we know that we are of the truth , and shall assure our hearts before him .
For if our heart condemn us , God is greater than our heart , and knoweth all things .
Beloved , if our heart condemn us not , then have we confidence toward God .
And whatsoever we ask , we receive of him , because we keep his commandments , and do those things that are pleasing in his sight .
And this is his commandment , That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ , and love one another , as he gave us commandment .
And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him , and he in him . And hereby we know that he abideth in us , by the Spirit which he hath given us .
Beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of God : because many false prophets are gone out into the world .
Hereby know ye the Spirit of God : Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God .
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God : and this is that spirit of antichrist , whereof ye have heard that it should come ; and even now already is it in the world .
Ye are of God , little children , and have overcome them : because greater is he that is in you , than he that is in the world .
They are of the world : therefore speak they of the world , and the world heareth them .
We are of God : he that knoweth God heareth us ; he that is not of God heareth not us . Hereby know we the spirit of truth , and the spirit of error .
Beloved , let us love one another : for love is of God ; and every one that loveth is born of God , and knoweth God .
He that loveth not knoweth not God ; for God is love .
In this was manifested the love of God toward us , because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world , that we might live through him .
Herein is love , not that we loved God , but that he loved us , and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins .
Beloved , if God so loved us , we ought also to love one another .
No man hath seen God at any time . If we love one another , God dwelleth in us , and his love is perfected in us .
Hereby know we that we dwell in him , and he in us , because he hath given us of his Spirit .
And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world .
Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God , God dwelleth in him , and he in God .
And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us . God is love ; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him .
Herein is our love made perfect , that we may have boldness in the day of judgment : because as he is , so are we in this world .
There is no fear in love ; but perfect love casteth out fear : because fear hath torment . He that feareth is not made perfect in love .
We love him , because he first loved us .
If a man say , I love God , and hateth his brother , he is a liar : for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ?
And this commandment have we from him , That he who loveth God love his brother also .
Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God : and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him .
By this we know that we love the children of God , when we love God , and keep his commandments .
For this is the love of God , that we keep his commandments : and his commandments are not grievous .
For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world : and this is the victory that overcometh the world , even our faith .
Who is he that overcometh the world , but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God ?
This is he that came by water and blood , even Jesus Christ ; not by water only , but by water and blood . And it is the Spirit that beareth witness , because the Spirit is truth .
For there are three that bear record in heaven , the Father , the Word , and the Holy Ghost : and these three are one .
And there are three that bear witness in earth , the Spirit , and the water , and the blood : and these three agree in one .
If we receive the witness of men , the witness of God is greater : for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son .
He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself : he that believeth not God hath made him a liar ; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son .
And this is the record , that God hath given to us eternal life , and this life is in his Son .
He that hath the Son hath life ; and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life .
These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God ; that ye may know that ye have eternal life , and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God .
And this is the confidence that we have in him , that , if we ask any thing according to his will , he heareth us .
And if we know that he hear us , whatsoever we ask , we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him .
If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death , he shall ask , and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death . There is a sin unto death : I do not say that he shall pray for it .
All unrighteousness is sin : and there is a sin not unto death .
We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not ; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself , and that wicked one toucheth him not .
And we know that we are of God , and the whole world lieth in wickedness .
And we know that the Son of God is come , and hath given us an understanding , that we may know him that is true , and we are in him that is true , even in his Son Jesus Christ . This is the true God , and eternal life .
Little children , keep yourselves from idols . Amen .
The elder unto the elect lady and her children , whom I love in the truth ; and not I only , but also all they that have known the truth .
For the truth ' s sake , which dwelleth in us , and shall be with us for ever .
Grace be with you , mercy , and peace , from God the Father , and from the Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of the Father , in truth and love .
I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth , as we have received a commandment from the Father .
And now I beseech thee , lady , not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee , but that which we had from the beginning , that we love one another .
And this is love , that we walk after his commandments . This is the commandment , That , as ye have heard from the beginning , ye should walk in it .
For many deceivers are entered into the world , who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh . This is a deceiver and an antichrist .
Look to yourselves , that we lose not those things which we have wrought , but that we receive a full reward .
Whosoever transgresseth , and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ , hath not God . He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ , he hath both the Father and the Son .
If there come any unto you , and bring not this doctrine , receive him not into your house , neither bid him God speed .
For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds .
Having many things to write unto you , I would not write with paper and ink : but I trust to come unto you , and speak face to face , that our joy may be full .
The children of thy elect sister greet thee . Amen .
The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius , whom I love in the truth .
Beloved , I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health , even as thy soul prospereth .
For I rejoiced greatly , when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee , even as thou walkest in the truth .
I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth .
Beloved , thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren , and to strangers .
Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church : whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort , thou shalt do well .
Because that for his name ' s sake they went forth , taking nothing of the Gentiles .
We therefore ought to receive such , that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth .
I wrote unto the church : but Diotrephes , who loveth to have the preeminence among them , receiveth us not .
Wherefore , if I come , I will remember his deeds which he doeth , prating against us with malicious words : and not content therewith , neither doth he himself receive the brethren , and forbiddeth them that would , and casteth them out of the church .
Beloved , follow not that which is evil , but that which is good . He that doeth good is of God : but he that doeth evil hath not seen God .
Demetrius hath good report of all men , and of the truth itself : yea , and we also bear record ; and ye know that our record is true .
I had many things to write , but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee .
But I trust I shall shortly see thee , and we shall speak face to face . Peace be to thee . Our friends salute thee . Greet the friends by name .
Jude , the servant of Jesus Christ , and brother of James , to them that are sanctified by God the Father , and preserved in Jesus Christ , and called .
Mercy unto you , and peace , and love , be multiplied .
Beloved , when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation , it was needful for me to write unto you , and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints .
For there are certain men crept in unawares , who were before of old ordained to this condemnation , ungodly men , turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness , and denying the only Lord God , and our Lord Jesus Christ .
I will therefore put you in remembrance , though ye once knew this , how that the Lord , having saved the people out of the land of Egypt , afterward destroyed them that believed not .
And the angels which kept not their first estate , but left their own habitation , he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day .
Even as Sodom and Gomorrha , and the cities about them in like manner , giving themselves over to fornication , and going after strange flesh , are set forth for an example , suffering the vengeance of eternal fire .
Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh , despise dominion , and speak evil of dignities .
Yet Michael the archangel , when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses , durst not bring against him a railing accusation , but said , The Lord rebuke thee .
But these speak evil of those things which they know not : but what they know naturally , as brute beasts , in those things they corrupt themselves .
Woe unto them ! for they have gone in the way of Cain , and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward , and perished in the gainsaying of Core .
These are spots in your feasts of charity , when they feast with you , feeding themselves without fear : clouds they are without water , carried about of winds ; trees whose fruit withereth , without fruit , twice dead , plucked up by the roots .
Raging waves of the sea , foaming out their own shame ; wandering stars , to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever .
And Enoch also , the seventh from Adam , prophesied of these , saying , Behold , the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints .
To execute judgment upon all , and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed , and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him .
These are murmurers , complainers , walking after their own lusts ; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words , having men ' s persons in admiration because of advantage .
But , beloved , remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ .
How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time , who should walk after their own ungodly lusts .
These be they who separate themselves , sensual , having not the Spirit .
But ye , beloved , building up yourselves on your most holy faith , praying in the Holy Ghost .
Keep yourselves in the love of God , looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life .
And of some have compassion , making a difference .
And others save with fear , pulling them out of the fire ; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh .
Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling , and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy .
To the only wise God our Saviour , be glory and majesty , dominion and power , both now and ever . Amen .
The Revelation of Jesus Christ , which God gave unto him , to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass ; and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John .
Who bare record of the word of God , and of the testimony of Jesus Christ , and of all things that he saw .
Blessed is he that readeth , and they that hear the words of this prophecy , and keep those things which are written therein : for the time is at hand .
John to the seven churches which are in Asia : Grace be unto you , and peace , from him which is , and which was , and which is to come ; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne .
And from Jesus Christ , who is the faithful witness , and the first begotten of the dead , and the prince of the kings of the earth . Unto him that loved us , and washed us from our sins in his own blood .
And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father ; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever . Amen .
Behold , he cometh with clouds ; and every eye shall see him , and they also which pierced him : and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him . Even so , Amen .
I am Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the ending , saith the Lord , which is , and which was , and which is to come , the Almighty .
I John , who also am your brother , and companion in tribulation , and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ , was in the isle that is called Patmos , for the word of God , and for the testimony of Jesus Christ .
I was in the Spirit on the Lord ' s day , and heard behind me a great voice , as of a trumpet .
Saying , I am Alpha and Omega , the first and the last : and , What thou seest , write in a book , and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia ; unto Ephesus , and unto Smyrna , and unto Pergamos , and unto Thyatira , and unto Sardis , and unto Philadelphia , and unto Laodicea .
And I turned to see the voice that spake with me . And being turned , I saw seven golden candlesticks .
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man , clothed with a garment down to the foot , and girt about the paps with a golden girdle .
His head and his hairs were white like wool , as white as snow ; and his eyes were as a flame of fire .
And his feet like unto fine brass , as if they burned in a furnace ; and his voice as the sound of many waters .
And he had in his right hand seven stars : and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword : and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength .
And when I saw him , I fell at his feet as dead . And he laid his right hand upon me , saying unto me , Fear not ; I am the first and the last .
I am he that liveth , and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive for evermore , Amen ; and have the keys of hell and of death .
Write the things which thou hast seen , and the things which are , and the things which shall be hereafter .
The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand , and the seven golden candlesticks . The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches : and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches .
Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write ; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand , who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks .
I know thy works , and thy labour , and thy patience , and how thou canst not bear them which are evil : and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles , and are not , and hast found them liars .
And hast borne , and hast patience , and for my name ' s sake hast laboured , and hast not fainted .
Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee , because thou hast left thy first love .
Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen , and repent , and do the first works ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will remove thy candlestick out of his place , except thou repent .
But this thou hast , that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans , which I also hate .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life , which is in the midst of the paradise of God .
And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write ; These things saith the first and the last , which was dead , and is alive .
I know thy works , and tribulation , and poverty , ( but thou art rich ) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews , and are not , but are the synagogue of Satan .
Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer : behold , the devil shall cast some of you into prison , that ye may be tried ; and ye shall have tribulation ten days : be thou faithful unto death , and I will give thee a crown of life .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death .
And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write ; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges .
I know thy works , and where thou dwellest , even where Satan ' s seat is : and thou holdest fast my name , and hast not denied my faith , even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr , who was slain among you , where Satan dwelleth .
But I have a few things against thee , because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam , who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel , to eat things sacrificed unto idols , and to commit fornication .
So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans , which thing I hate .
Repent ; or else I will come unto thee quickly , and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches ; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna , and will give him a white stone , and in the stone a new name written , which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it .
And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write ; These things saith the Son of God , who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire , and his feet are like fine brass .
I know thy works , and charity , and service , and faith , and thy patience , and thy works ; and the last to be more than the first .
Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee , because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel , which calleth herself a prophetess , to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication , and to eat things sacrificed unto idols .
And I gave her space to repent of her fornication ; and she repented not .
Behold , I will cast her into a bed , and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation , except they repent of their deeds .
And I will kill her children with death ; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts : and I will give unto every one of you according to your works .
But unto you I say , and unto the rest in Thyatira , as many as have not this doctrine , and which have not known the depths of Satan , as they speak ; I will put upon you none other burden .
But that which ye have already hold fast till I come .
And he that overcometh , and keepeth my works unto the end , to him will I give power over the nations .
And he shall rule them with a rod of iron ; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers : even as I received of my Father .
And I will give him the morning star .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write ; These things saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God , and the seven stars ; I know thy works , that thou hast a name that thou livest , and art dead .
Be watchful , and strengthen the things which remain , that are ready to die : for I have not found thy works perfect before God .
Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard , and hold fast , and repent . If therefore thou shalt not watch , I will come on thee as a thief , and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee .
Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments ; and they shall walk with me in white : for they are worthy .
He that overcometh , the same shall be clothed in white raiment ; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life , but I will confess his name before my Father , and before his angels .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write ; These things saith he that is holy , he that is true , he that hath the key of David , he that openeth , and no man shutteth ; and shutteth , and no man openeth .
I know thy works : behold , I have set before thee an open door , and no man can shut it : for thou hast a little strength , and hast kept my word , and hast not denied my name .
Behold , I will make them of the synagogue of Satan , which say they are Jews , and are not , but do lie ; behold , I will make them to come and worship before thy feet , and to know that I have loved thee .
Because thou hast kept the word of my patience , I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation , which shall come upon all the world , to try them that dwell upon the earth .
Behold , I come quickly : hold that fast which thou hast , that no man take thy crown .
Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God , and he shall go no more out : and I will write upon him the name of my God , and the name of the city of my God , which is new Jerusalem , which cometh down out of heaven from my God : and I will write upon him my new name .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write ; These things saith the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of the creation of God .
I know thy works , that thou art neither cold nor hot : I would thou wert cold or hot .
So then because thou art lukewarm , and neither cold nor hot , I will spue thee out of my mouth .
Because thou sayest , I am rich , and increased with goods , and have need of nothing ; and knowest not that thou art wretched , and miserable , and poor , and blind , and naked .
I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire , that thou mayest be rich ; and white raiment , that thou mayest be clothed , and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear ; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve , that thou mayest see .
As many as I love , I rebuke and chasten : be zealous therefore , and repent .
Behold , I stand at the door , and knock : if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him , and will sup with him , and he with me .
To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne , even as I also overcame , and am set down with my Father in his throne .
He that hath an ear , let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches .
After this I looked , and , behold , a door was opened in heaven : and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me ; which said , Come up hither , and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter .
And immediately I was in the spirit : and , behold , a throne was set in heaven , and one sat on the throne .
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone : and there was a rainbow round about the throne , in sight like unto an emerald .
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats : and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting , clothed in white raiment ; and they had on their heads crowns of gold .
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices : and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne , which are the seven Spirits of God .
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal : and in the midst of the throne , and round about the throne , were four beasts full of eyes before and behind .
And the first beast was like a lion , and the second beast like a calf , and the third beast had a face as a man , and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle .
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him ; and they were full of eyes within : and they rest not day and night , saying , Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , which was , and is , and is to come .
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne , who liveth for ever and ever .
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne , and worship him that liveth for ever and ever , and cast their crowns before the throne , saying .
Thou art worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honour and power : for thou hast created all things , and for thy pleasure they are and were created .
And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside , sealed with seven seals .
And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice , Who is worthy to open the book , and to loose the seals thereof ?
And no man in heaven , nor in earth , neither under the earth , was able to open the book , neither to look thereon .
And I wept much , because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book , neither to look thereon .
And one of the elders saith unto me , Weep not : behold , the Lion of the tribe of Juda , the Root of David , hath prevailed to open the book , and to loose the seven seals thereof .
And I beheld , and , lo , in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts , and in the midst of the elders , stood a Lamb as it had been slain , having seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth .
And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne .
And when he had taken the book , the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb , having every one of them harps , and golden vials full of odours , which are the prayers of saints .
And they sung a new song , saying , Thou art worthy to take the book , and to open the seals thereof : for thou wast slain , and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred , and tongue , and people , and nation .
And hast made us unto our God kings and priests : and we shall reign on the earth .
And I beheld , and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders : and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand , and thousands of thousands .
Saying with a loud voice , Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power , and riches , and wisdom , and strength , and honour , and glory , and blessing .
And every creature which is in heaven , and on the earth , and under the earth , and such as are in the sea , and all that are in them , heard I saying , Blessing , and honour , and glory , and power , be unto him that sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb for ever and ever .
And the four beasts said , Amen . And the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever .
And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals , and I heard , as it were the noise of thunder , one of the four beasts saying , Come and see .
And I saw , and behold a white horse : and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown was given unto him : and he went forth conquering , and to conquer .
And when he had opened the second seal , I heard the second beast say , Come and see .
And there went out another horse that was red : and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth , and that they should kill one another : and there was given unto him a great sword .
And when he had opened the third seal , I heard the third beast say , Come and see . And I beheld , and lo a black horse ; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand .
And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say , A measure of wheat for a penny , and three measures of barley for a penny ; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine .
And when he had opened the fourth seal , I heard the voice of the fourth beast say , Come and see .
And I looked , and behold a pale horse : and his name that sat on him was Death , and Hell followed with him . And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth , to kill with sword , and with hunger , and with death , and with the beasts of the earth .
And when he had opened the fifth seal , I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God , and for the testimony which they held .
And they cried with a loud voice , saying , How long , O Lord , holy and true , dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth ?
And white robes were given unto every one of them ; and it was said unto them , that they should rest yet for a little season , until their fellowservants also and their brethren , that should be killed as they were , should be fulfilled .
And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal , and , lo , there was a great earthquake ; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair , and the moon became as blood .
And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth , even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs , when she is shaken of a mighty wind .
And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together ; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places .
And the kings of the earth , and the great men , and the rich men , and the chief captains , and the mighty men , and every bondman , and every free man , hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains .
And said to the mountains and rocks , Fall on us , and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne , and from the wrath of the Lamb .
For the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be able to stand ?
And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth , holding the four winds of the earth , that the wind should not blow on the earth , nor on the sea , nor on any tree .
And I saw another angel ascending from the east , having the seal of the living God : and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels , to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea .
Saying , Hurt not the earth , neither the sea , nor the trees , till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads .
And I heard the number of them which were sealed : and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel .
Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Nepthalim were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand .
Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand . Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand .
After this I beheld , and , lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds , and people , and tongues , stood before the throne , and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes , and palms in their hands .
And cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne , and unto the Lamb .
And all the angels stood round about the throne , and about the elders and the four beasts , and fell before the throne on their faces , and worshipped God .
Saying , Amen : Blessing , and glory , and wisdom , and thanksgiving , and honour , and power , and might , be unto our God for ever and ever . Amen .
And one of the elders answered , saying unto me , What are these which are arrayed in white robes ? and whence came they ?
And I said unto him , Sir , thou knowest . And he said to me , These are they which came out of great tribulation , and have washed their robes , and made them white in the blood of the Lamb .
Therefore are they before the throne of God , and serve him day and night in his temple : and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them .
They shall hunger no more , neither thirst any more ; neither shall the sun light on them , nor any heat .
For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them , and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters : and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes .
And when he had opened the seventh seal , there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour .
And I saw the seven angels which stood before God ; and to them were given seven trumpets .
And another angel came and stood at the altar , having a golden censer ; and there was given unto him much incense , that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne .
And the smoke of the incense , which came with the prayers of the saints , ascended up before God out of the angel ' s hand .
And the angel took the censer , and filled it with fire of the altar , and cast it into the earth : and there were voices , and thunderings , and lightnings , and an earthquake .
And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound .
The first angel sounded , and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood , and they were cast upon the earth : and the third part of trees was burnt up , and all green grass was burnt up .
And the second angel sounded , and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea : and the third part of the sea became blood .
And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea , and had life , died ; and the third part of the ships were destroyed .
And the third angel sounded , and there fell a great star from heaven , burning as it were a lamp , and it fell upon the third part of the rivers , and upon the fountains of waters .
And the name of the star is called Wormwood : and the third part of the waters became wormwood ; and many men died of the waters , because they were made bitter .
And the fourth angel sounded , and the third part of the sun was smitten , and the third part of the moon , and the third part of the stars ; so as the third part of them was darkened , and the day shone not for a third part of it , and the night likewise .
And I beheld , and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven , saying with a loud voice , Woe , woe , woe , to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels , which are yet to sound !
And the fifth angel sounded , and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth : and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit .
And he opened the bottomless pit ; and there arose a smoke out of the pit , as the smoke of a great furnace ; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit .
And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth : and unto them was given power , as the scorpions of the earth have power .
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth , neither any green thing , neither any tree ; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads .
