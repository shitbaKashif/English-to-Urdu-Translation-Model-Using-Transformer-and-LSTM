The orphaned relative .
Or the poverty - stricken destitute who is just rundown ( and homeless ) .
( Provided this striving soul is ) one of those who believe and advise one another patience and tolerance and urge one another for mutual affection and mercy .
These are the people of the Right Hand ( the privileged and the pardoned ) .
And those who reject Our Signs are the people of the Left Hand ( the callous and the doomed ) .
Fire will be enclosed upon them ( covering from all sides ) .
By the sun and by its brightness .
And by the moon when it follows the sun ( reflects sunshine ) .
And by the day when it displays the sun ( brings it forth shining ) .
And by the night when it draws a veil over the sun ( from one of the hemispheres of the earth ) .
And by the heaven and by that ( energy ) which built it ( with Allahs permission in the form of a vast universe ) .
And by the earth and by that ( force which , by Allahs Command , ) pulled it ( from the sun far ) apart .
And by the human soul and by the One Who provided it with an all - dimensional poise , proportion and perfection .
Then He inspired it with ( discrimination between ) vice and virtue .
Indeed the one who purifies his ( ill - commanding ) self ( from all vain and vicious desires and cultivates in it virtue and piousness ) succeeds .
But the one who corrupts himself ( in sins and suppresses virtue ) is doomed indeed .
The people of Thamud rejected ( their Messenger Salih ) due to their rebellion .
When the most wretched of them stood up .
Allahs Messenger said to them : Guard ( that ) she - camel and ( the time of ) her taking water .
But they rejected the Messenger and hamstrung ( the she - camel ) . So because of their sin their Lord sent down destruction on them and levelled ( them all in the torment devastating ) the town .
And Allah does not fear any repercussions of this ( devastation ) .
By the night when it covers up ( and conceals everything in its darkness ) .
And by the day when it brightens up .
And by that Being Who created male and female ( in everything ) .
Indeed your striving is different ( and singular ) .
So he who gives away ( his wealth in the way of Allah ) and commits himself to piousness .
And affirms good ( Din [ Religion ] ) of Truth and life after death through charity and Godwariness ) .
Soon We shall facilitate him in seeking ( Allahs pleasure ) with ease .
But he who is miser and disregards ( spending in the cause of Allah ) .
And ( in this way ) belies good ( Din [ Religion ] ) of Truth and life after death ) .
Soon shall We facilitate him landing into hardship ( advancing towards torment , so that punishment becomes his rightful due ) .
And his wealth will not help him any way when he falls into ( the pit of ) destruction .
Indeed it is binding on Us to show you the path ( of Truth ) .
And indeed We are the Master of the Hereafter and the world .
So I have warned you of the raging Fire ( of Hell ) .
No one but only the most wretched shall enter it .
Who denies ( Din [ Religion ] of Truth ) and turns away ( from obedience to the Messenger [ blessings and peace be upon him ] ) .
But the most pious shall be saved from this ( Fire ) .
Who gives his wealth away ( in the cause of Allah ) to attain to purity ( of his soul and assets ) .
And who owes no favour to anyone that he is seeking to pay back .
Rather ( he spends ) seeking the pleasure of his Lord , Most High .
And soon shall he be well - pleased ( with Allah for His bestowal and Allah with him for his fidelity ) .
By the growing morning bright ( when the sun gains height and spreads its radiance ) .
And by the night when it covers up .
( Ever since He has chosen you , ) your Lord has not forsaken you . Nor is He displeased ( ever since He has taken you as His Beloved ) .
Indeed every following hour is a better ( source of eminence and exaltation ) for you than the preceding one .
And soon your Lord shall bestow upon you ( so much ) that you will be well - pleased .
( O Beloved ! ) Did He not find you an orphan , and then provided you ( a dignifying and graceful ) abode ?
And He found you engrossed and lost in His love and then made you achieve the coveted objective .
And He found you seeking ( union with your Lord ) and ( then blessed you with the pleasure of His sight and ) freed you of every need ( forever ) .
So , never should you be strict with any orphan .
Nor reproach any beggar ( seeking help at your door ) .
And proclaim ( well ) the bounties of your Lord .
Have We not broadened your breast for you ( for the light of knowledge , wisdom and spiritual gnosis ) ?
And We have taken off the load ( of grief of the Umma [ Community ] ) from you .
( The load ) which was growing heavier on your ( holy ) back .
And We exalted for you your remembrance ( by annexing it to Ours everywhere in the world and in the Hereafter ) .
So surely ease ( comes ) with every hardship .
Verily , with ( this ) hardship ( too ) there is ease .
So when you are free ( from educating the Umma ( Community ) , preaching Din ( Religion ) and fighting , and fulfilling your responsibilities ) then strive hard ( in remembrance and worship of your Lord ) .
And turn to your Lord earnestly .
By the fig and by the olive !
And by ( Mount ) Tur of Sinai !
And by this city of peace ( Makka ) !
Indeed We have created man in the best constitution ( equipoised in the finest proportion ) .
Then We returned him to the lowest state of the low .
Except for those who believe and do good works . For them is an unending ( everlasting ) reward .
Then who denies you after this regarding Din ( Religion or the Last Hour and reward and punishment ) ?
Is not Allah the Greatest of all the sovereigns ?
( O Beloved ! ) Read ( commencing ) with the Name of Allah , Who has created ( everything ) .
He created man from a hanging mass ( clinging ) like a leech ( in the mothers womb ) .
Read and your Lord is Most Generous .
Who taught man ( reading and writing ) by the pen .
Who ( besides that ) taught man ( all that ) which he did not know .
( But ) the fact is that ( the disobedient ) man rebels .
For the reason that ( apparently ) he finds himself self - sufficient ( in the world ) .
Surely ( every man ) has to return to your Lord .
Have you seen him who prevents .
The servant ( of Allah ) when he prays ?
Well , imagine ! If he had been rightly guided .
Or if he had commanded ( the people ) to be pious ( how beneficial it would have been ) !
But see now , when he has rejected ( the true Din [ Religion ] ) and has turned away ( from you , what torment is he going to face ? )
Does he not know that Allah monitors ( minutely all his conduct ) ?
Beware ! If he does not desist ( from the denigration of the Holy Prophet and antagonism against the true Din [ Religion ] ) , We shall certainly grab his forehead and drag him by the forelock .
His lying ( and ) sinful forehead !
Then let him call his companions ( for help ) .
We too shall soon call ( Our ) guards ( the angels appointed to inflict the punishment of Hell ) .
No indeed ! Do not pay any heed to his doings and , ( O Esteemed Beloved , ) persist in prostration and keep drawing near ( Us more and more ) .
Surely We sent down this ( Holy Quran ) during the Night of Destiny .
And what have you made out what the Night of Destiny is ?
The Night of Destiny is better than a thousand months ( in merit of excellence , blessings , reward and recompense ) .
The angels and the Spirit of Peace ( Gabriel ) descend by their Lords Command during this ( night ) with decrees concerning all matters ( of blessings and bounties ) .
This ( night ) is ( absolute ) peace and security till daybreak .
The disbelievers from among the People of the Book and the idolaters would not desist ( from disbelief ) until clear proof came to them .
That ( proof ) is the ( last ) Messenger from Allah , who recites ( to them ) holy pages ( of the Glorious Quran ) .
In which are ( written ) correct and firm Commandments .
These People of the Book did not dissent among themselves ( with regard to believing in the Prophethood and Messengership of the last Messenger [ Allah bless him and give him peace ] and recognizing his holy status ) , until after the clear proof had come to them ( of the Prophethood of Muhammad [ Allah bless him and give him peace ] .
Then , they broke up : some of them accepted belief in him while others became deniers and disbelievers out of jealousy , )
Whereas they were commanded to worship only Allah , making their Din ( faith and devotion ) sincerely His ( dissociating from every falsehood ) , to establish Prayer and to pay Zakat ( the Alms - due ) regularly . And this is the straight and firm Din ( Religion ) .
Indeed those who disbelieve from among the People of the Book and the polytheists ( all ) will be ( abiding ) in the Fire of Hell . They are its permanent dwellers . It is they who are the worst of the Creation .
Indeed those who believe and keep doing pious actions , it is they who are the best of the Creation .
Their reward is the Gardens of eternal living in the Presence of their Lord , with streams flowing under them . They shall live in them forever . Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him . This ( status ) is meant for the one who fears his Lord .
When the earth will be violently shaken with a high - scale quake .
And when the earth will throw out ( all ) her burdens .
And man ( bewildered and baffled ) will say : What has happened to her ?
On that Day she will herself bring to light her experiences .
For your Lord will have made subservient to her ( the symbolic language of ) sharp signals .
On that Day people will form up in different groups , ( in diverse conditions , ) so that they may be shown their works .
Then he who will have done even an atoms weight of good will see it .
And he who will have done even an atoms weight of evil will ( also ) see it .
By the charging horses that gallop ( in the battlefield ) and pant .
And those that produce sparks striking their hoofs on rocks .
Then they blitz ( the enemy ) at dawn .
And then raise clouds of dust from the point ( of attack ) .
And then simultaneously pierce into ( the enemy ) ranks .
Indeed man is most ungrateful to his Lord .
And verily he is himself a witness to this ingratitude .
And indeed he is quite stubborn in his love of wealth .
But does he not know when those ( dead ) in the graves will be raised .
And secrets which are in hearts will be disclosed ?
Indeed their Lord will be Well Aware of their ( deeds ) on that Day ?
The high - scale jolt rocking ( the whole universe of the heavens and the earth ) and thunder !
And what is that high - scale jolt rocking ( everything ) and that thunder ?
And what have you made out what the high - scale jolt and thunder implies ?
( It implies ) the Day of Resurrection when ( the whole of ) mankind will become like scattered moths .
And the mountains will be like multicoloured carded wool .
So he whose scales of deeds in the balance will be heavy .
He will be in luxury and delight .
But as for him whose scales of deeds in the balance will be light .
His abode will be Hawiya ( a pit in Hell ) !
And what have you made out what that ( Hawiya ) is ?
It is ( an extremely deep pit of ) the fiercely Blazing Fire ( of Hell ) .
Your greed for massive wealth and the superiority complex has made you negligent ( of the Hereafter ) .
Until you go down to the graves .
No indeed ! You will soon learn ( this reality that wealth and riches will avail you nothing ) .
Again ( you are warned . ) No ! Never ! You will soon learn about ( your end ) .
Yes indeed ! Would that you knew with the knowledge of certitude ( the consequence of greed for wealth and riches and your negligence . Then , lost in the worldly pleasures , you would never forget the Hereafter like this ) .
( Consequent on your greed ) you shall surely see Hell .
Then you shall certainly see it with the eye of certitude .
Then on that Day you will certainly be questioned about the bounties ( given to you by Allah and the way you consumed them ) .
By the passing time ( whose rotation bears witness to the affairs of mankind ) .
Indeed man is at a loss ( for he is losing his valuable lifetime ) .
Except for those who believe and do good deeds and exhort one another to Truth and exhort one another to patience ( in the face of hardships and afflictions that are faced while preaching the Din [ Religion ] of Truth ) .
Woe to everyone who slanders ( face to face ) and finds fault ( in absence ) !
( Woe to him ) who accumulates wealth and keeps counting it !
He thinks that his riches will keep him alive forever .
By no means ! He shall certainly be cast into al - Hutama ( the crushing up Fire ) .
And what will make you understand what al - Hutama is ( the crushing up Fire ) ?
( It ) is a fire kindled by Allah .
That will rise over the hearts ( with its torture ) .
Indeed that ( Fire ) will be closed upon them all around .
In towering columns ( of fierce flames and they will not find any way to escape ) .
Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with those who had elephants ?
Did He not thwart their crafty designs ?
And He sent on to them ( ambient ) swarms of birds .
Which pelted them with stone - hard slugs .
Then ( Allah made them perish ) like chewed - up chaff .
To awake drive among the Quraish .
They were acclimatized to the summer and winter ( commercial ) trips .
So they should worship the Lord of this ( Sacred ) House ( Kaba , to give Him thanks ) .
Who has fed them in hunger ( i . e . provided them sustenance in starving conditions ) and secured them from fear ( of foes i . e . blessed them with secure and peaceful life ) .
Have you seen him who denies Din ( Religion ) ?
So he is the one who pushes away the orphan ( i . e . rejects the needs of the orphans and deprives them of their right ) .
And does not promote the cause of feeding the poor ( i . e . does not strive to end the economic exploitation of the poor and the needy ) .
So woe to those worshippers .
Who are unaware of ( the spirit of ) their Prayers ( i . e . they are mindful only of the rights of Allah but are heedless of the rights of fellow human beings ) .
Who show off ( their worship , for they only render a formal service to the Creator and are inconsiderate to the oppressed humanity ) .
And who refuse to lend even a worthless small object of use even on demand !
Indeed We have bestowed on you an infinite abundance , ( every kind of superiority , bliss and bounty ) .
So pray to your Lord and offer sacrifice ( a token of gratitude ) .
Indeed your enemy will remain childless and his race will be cut off .
Say : O disbelievers !
I do not worship those ( idols ) that you worship .
Nor do you worship ( the Lord ) Whom I worship .
I shall never ( ever ) worship those ( idols ) that you worship .
Nor shall you ( ever ) worship ( the Lord ) Whom I worship .
( So ) you have your Din ( Religion ) and I have my Din ( Religion ) .
When there comes Allahs help and victory .
And you see people joining Allahs Din ( Religion ) in droves .
Then hymn Allahs praise ( in gratitude ) , glorifying Him , and beg Him ( humbly ) for pardon . Surely He is Ever - Relenting and Oft - Returning ( with evermore compassion ) .
Perished be the two hands of Abu Lahab and be he perished himself , ( he has pointed his finger to Our Beloved ) !
Neither His ( inherited ) wealth nor his earned riches have given him any benefit .
Soon he will tumble into the Flaming Fire .
And his ( damned , wretched ) wife ( too ) who carries ( on her head ) the burden of ( thorny ) twigs ( and spreads them in the way of Our Beloved , to injure his holy soles ) .
Around her neck will be ( the same ) palm - fibre rope ( which she uses to bind the bunch of thorny twigs ) .
( O Esteemed Messenger ! ) Proclaim : He is Allah , Who is the One .
Allah is the Transcendent of all , the Protector and Far - Superior to all .
He has not begotten any nor is He begotten .
Nor is there anyone equal to Him .
Beseech : I seek refuge with the Lord Who brought ( the universe ) into existence with ( an ) explosion extremely fast .
From the evil influence ( and harmfulness ) of everything that He has created .
And ( in particular ) from the evil of murky night when ( its ) darkness prevails .
And from the evil of those women ( and men ) who practise magic on knots by blowing .
And from the mischief of every one jealous when he feels jealous .
Beseech : I seek refuge with the Lord of ( the whole of ) mankind .
Who is the King of ( all ) mankind .
Who is the God of the ( whole ) human race .
From the evil of slinking whisperer ( Satan ) who hides himself withdrawing ( from the influence of Allahs remembrance ) .
Who whispers into the hearts of mankind .
Whether he ( the whispering Satan ) comes from the jinn or mankind .
