And he ( the glorious Messenger ) is not at all miserly in ( disclosing ) the Unseen . ( The Lord of the Throne has not left for him any deficiency . )
Nor is that ( Quran ) the utterance of any accursed Satan .
Then , ( O you doomed , ) where are you going ( disregarding such a valuable treasure ) ?
This ( Quran ) is but admonition ( revealed ) for all the worlds .
Everyone of you who aspires to tread the straight path ( can take guidance from this source spring ) .
And you can aspire only to what Allah intends , Who is the Sustainer of all the worlds .
When ( all ) the heavenly spheres will be split apart .
And when the planets will fall and scatter .
And when oceans ( and rivers ) will flood and overflow .
And when graves will be overturned .
Then everyone will come to know what actions he sent forward and what he left behind .
O man ! What has deluded you concerning your Gracious Lord .
( The One ) Who created you ( from a fertiled ovum in the mothers womb ) , then ( to structure your limbs at the fetal stage ) He shaped you aright , then brought about proportionate alteration in your constitution ?
He constituted you in whatever form He willed .
That is the Truth ( but ) on the contrary you deny the Day of Recompense .
Whereas there are guardian angels appointed over you .
( Who are ) dignified , the scribes ( writing the records of all your deeds ) .
They know ( all ) those ( actions ) which you do .
Indeed , the truly good will be in the Garden of Bliss .
And surely the evildoers will be in the ( Blazing Fire of ) Hell .
They will enter it on the Day of Rising .
And will never be able to absent themselves from it ( Hell ) .
And what have you made out what the Day of Recompense is ?
So what have you learnt about what the Day of Recompense is ?
It is the Day when no soul will own anything for any other soul and the Command on that Day will be entirely Allahs .
Woe to those who give less in measure or weight !
When ( they ) take by measure from others they take ( from them ) full .
And when they ( themselves ) give by measure or weigh to others they give them less .
Do they not believe that they will be raised up ( again after death ) .
For a Terrible Day .
The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of all the worlds ?
This is the Truth that the record of the evildoers is kept in Sijjin ( the ante - chamber of Hell ) .
And what do you know what Sijjin is ?
It is an inscribed book ( set down in the large ante - chamber of the prison of Hell , with the names and evil deeds of every inmate of Hell registered in it ) .
Woe to the deniers on that Day .
Those who deny the Day of Recompense !
And no one else denies it except every defiant and sinner .
When Our Revelations are read out to him , he says ( or thinks ) that ( they are ) tales of the ancients .
That is not at all ( the case ) ; rather ( the fact is that the evil deeds ) which they earned have rusted their hearts . ( The Revelations , therefore , do not move their hearts . )
The Truth is that they will be screened off ( to deprive them of ) the sight of their Lord .
Then they will be cast into Hell .
Then it will be said to them : This is ( the punishment of Hell ) which you used to belie .
This is ( also ) True that the record of the truly pious is for sure maintained in Illiyyin ( the ante - chamber of Paradise ) .
And what do you know what Illiyyin is ?
It is an inscribed book ( set down in the large ante - chamber of a lofty mansion of Paradise with the names and pious deeds of those who will be allocated superior stations in Paradise ) .
The angels closest ( to Allah ) remain present here .
Indeed the truly pious , ( joyful and glad , ) will be in blissful Paradise .
Reclining on couches , enjoying the wonderful sights .
You will find on their faces the glow and freshness of bliss and delight .
They shall be served with securely sealed delicious and holy beverage .
Its seal will be musk . And ( it is this beverage which ) all aspirants should hastily strive and compete to acquire . ( Some seek the drink of bliss while others long for the drink of nearness and still others yearn for the drink of countenance all will be served according to their respective tastes ) .
And this ( beverage of Paradise ) will be mixed with the water of Tasnim .
( This Tasnim ) is a fountain at which only the Closer Ones drink .
Surely ( in the worldly life ) the evildoers used to ridicule the believers .
And winked at one another when they passed by them .
And when they went back to their families they used to exult over the believers ( by comparing the believers destitution and their own affluence ) and returned speaking of them with jests .
And when they ( the arrogant people ) saw these ( the indigent believers ) , they used to say : They have gone astray , ( i . e . they have lost the world while the Hereafter is nothing but fiction . )
Yet they had not been sent to watch over their ( state of affairs ) .
So ( see ) Today the believers are laughing at the disbelievers .
Reclining on ornamented couches , they are viewing the sight ( comparing their own prosperity and the disbelievers impoverishment ) .
So , have the disbelievers been rewarded in full for ( the mockery ) which they used to inflict upon ( the believers ) ?
When ( all ) the heavenly bodies will split asunder .
And obey the Command of their Lord ( with regard to the catastrophic split - up ) and ( it is this implementation of the Command ) that they are bound to do .
And when the earth will be flattened out ( after it is broken into dust particles ) .
And it will cast out all that is inside it and become empty .
And ( it ) will ( also ) obey the Command of its Lord ( with regard to catastrophic split - up ) and ( it is this obedience ) which it is worthy of .
O man ! You sustain rigours to reach your Lord . Ultimately you shall meet Him .
So as for him who will be given his record in his right hand .
He will soon be given an easy reckoning .
And will return to his family rejoicing .
And as for him who shall be given his record behind his back .
He will soon cry out for death .
And he will enter the Blazing Fire of Hell .
Surely he lived joyfully with his family ( in the world ) .
No doubt he thought he would never return ( to his Lord ) for Reckoning .
Why not ! Indeed his Lord is ever watching him .
So I swear by the evening glow ( i . e . the twilight or its later glare ) .
And by the night and all that it envelops ( under its embrace ) .
And the moon when it appears full .
You will assuredly ride along stage by stage .
So , what is the matter with them that ( even after witnessing the Truth of the forecast of the Quran ) , they do not believe ?
And when the Quran is recited to them , they do not fall down prostrate ( before Allah ) ?
Instead , the disbelievers ( further ) deny it .
And Allah knows best ( the contention and disbelief ) which they are piling .
So give them the news of a painful punishment .
But they who believe and do pious deeds , for them is an unending ( everlasting ) reward .
By the heaven with its Houses of the Zodiac ( galaxies ) .
And by the Promised Day .
And by the One Who will be Present ( that Day ) and by what will be brought to the Presence .
The ( people ) of the trenches were slain .
( The people of ) the fierce fire which was ( fed ) with abundant fuel .
When they sat beside it .
And they are themselves witnesses to all what they did to the believers ( i . e . casting them into the fire and burning them ) .
And nothing ( of the believers ) was annoying them except that they had believed in Allah Almighty , All - Praiseworthy .
To Whom the ( entire ) Kingdom of the heavens and the earth belongs and Allah is Witness over everything .
Indeed those who persecute the believing men and women and then do not ( even ) repent , for them is the punishment of Hell , and for them is ( especially ) the torment of burning in the Fire .
And indeed those who believe and keep doing pious deeds , for them are Gardens with streams flowing under them . This is the Great Victory .
Surely the seizure of your Lord is most severe .
Verily He creates the first time and He is the One Who will bring to life the second time .
He is the Most Forgiving , the Most Loving .
The Lord of the Throne ( controlling the whole universe ) and the Lord of Honour .
He ( thoroughly ) executes whatever He intends .
Has the news of the troops reached you ?
The troops of Pharaoh and Thamud ?
But such disbelievers ( persistently strive to ) belie ( the Truth ) .
And Allah encompasses ( them ) from all sides .
It is indeed the Glorious Quran .
( Inscribed ) in the very well - guarded tablet al - Lawh - al - Mahfuz .
By the ( endless expanse and infinite space of ) heaven and the Nightly ( discernable ) Visitant .
And what do you know what the Nightly ( discernable ) Visitant is ?
( It implies ) every heavenly body ( may it be a star , a planet or any one of the heavenly spheres ) which shines and brightens ( the space ) .
There is no human soul but with a protector ( appointed ) over it .
So man should ponder ( and find out ) from what substance he has been created .
He has been created from the ejaculated fluid ( i . e . virile and motile sperm ) .
That proceeds from the middle of the sacrum ( and pelvic girdle ) and gets ejected .
Indeed He has the Power to bring it ( life ) back .
The Day when all secrets will be disclosed .
Then man will have neither any strength ( himself ) nor any helper .
By the heavenly universe which will regress to its primitive state .
And by the earth which will split asunder ( and change into dust particles ) .
This is indeed a decisive ( absolute ) Commandment .
And it is no joke !
Indeed they ( the disbelievers ) are hatching plots .
And I am designing My own Strategy .
So give the disbelievers a respite ( for a while and not much but ) let them relax a little ( more ) .
Glorify the Name of your Lord , the Most High .
He Who has created ( everything in the Universe ) and then ( fulfilling all requisites ) equipoised it to its exact proportion .
And He Who has determined law , ( phenomena for every creation ) and guided it to its way ( of sustaining and functioning according to its respective system ) .
And He Who has brought forth green pasture ( from the earth ) .
And then made it blackened stubble .
( O Esteemed Beloved ! ) We shall teach you ( in a way ) that nothing shall you ( ever ) forget .
Except what Allah wills . Indeed He knows all , manifest as well as hidden ( i . e . open to human perception as well as veiled from it and the audible and inaudible both ) .
We shall ( also ) facilitate you ( to put into practice this ) easy ( Law ) .
So keep admonishing , provided admonition benefits ( the listeners ) .
But only he who fears ( Allah ) will accept the admonition .
And the wretched one will avoid and evade it .
He who will enter the greatest Fire ( on the Day of Judgment ) .
Then he will neither die nor live in it .
Indeed only he who is purified ( from the afflictions of his ill - commanding self and pollution of sins ) will triumph .
The one who remembers the Name of his Lord and offers Prayers ( regularly and abundantly ) .
Yet you go for the ( pleasures of ) the worldly life ( instead of turning towards Allah ) .
Whereas ( the relish for and comfort of ) the Hereafter is preferable and everlasting .
Indeed this ( enlightenment ) is ( also contained ) in earlier scriptures .
The scriptures of Ibrahim ( Abraham ) and Musa ( Moses ) .
Has the news reached you of the Calamity Overwhelming ( everything ) ?
Many faces on that Day will be humiliated and degraded .
( Forgetting Allah ) , toiling ( for worldly gains ) , sustaining ( strenuous ) rigours ( for a fleeting luxury ) .
Will plunge into the Blazing Fire .
( They will be ) offered to drink ( water ) from a boiling spring .
They shall have no food except thorny and dry , venomous herbage .
( This food ) will neither nourish nor gratify hunger .
( On the contrary ) that Day a number of faces will be ( pleasing to the eye , ) glowing with joy and freshness .
Delighted and rejoicing over their ( righteous ) ventures .
( Abiding ) in magnificent Paradise .
Where they will not hear anything absurd ( as the infidels used to say to them in the world ) .
In it there will be flowing springs .
And raised - up couches ( laid ) .
And goblets ( decently ) set in place .
And silken cushions orderly lined up .
And soft and refined carpets and rugs ( richly ) spread .
( The disbelievers wonder how all that would be arranged in Paradise . So ) do they not see how has the camel been created ( in an unusual form ) ?
And ( do they not observe ) how is the heaven raised so high ( with its infinite expanse ) ?
And ( do they not see ) how have the mountains been created ( raised out of the earth ) ?
( Nor do they consider ) how has the earth been spread out ( besides its round shape ) ?
So , continuously admonish them , for you are but an admonisher .
And not imposed upon them ( as ) a despot and oppressor .
But anyone who turns away and becomes a disbeliever .
Allah will torment him with the greatest punishment .
Indeed , it is to Us that they will return ( in the end ) .
Then surely it is Our concern to call them to account .
By the emerging dawn ( that dispels the darkness of night ) .
And by the ten ( blessed ) nights .
And by the even and the odd .
And by the night as it departs . ( Every night or particularly the Muzdalifa night or Qadr night . )
Surely in that is a mighty oath for the wise .
Have you not seen how your Lord treated ( the people of Ad ) ?
( They ) were ( the people ) of Iram ( and ) were ( tall like ) lofty columns , ( possessing towering castles ) .
The like of which has not ( at all ) been created in the countries ( of the world ) .
And ( what treatment was given to ) Thamud , who carved rocks ( and constructed hundreds of cities ) in the ( Qura ) valley ?
And ( how was ) Pharaoh ( dealt with ) who wielded big armies ( and used to punish victims with stakes ) ?
( They were ) the people who perpetrated tyranny in their ( respective ) countries .
And spread there great mischief and corruption .
Then your Lord unleashed the scourge of punishment on them .
Indeed , your Lord is Ever - Watchful ( over the tyrant rebels ) .
But ( so is ) man that when his Lord tests him ( by providing him pleasure and comfort ) and honours him and gives him bounties , he says : My Lord has honoured me .
But when He tries him ( by afflicting pain and discomfort ) and limits his means of sustenance , he says : My Lord has humiliated me .
No indeed ! But ( the truth is that after you gain honour and good fortune ) you do not give honour and care to orphans .
Nor do you inspire one another ( in society ) to promote feeding the destitute ( the poor and the needy ) .
You lay hand on the inherited wealth and devour it ( yourselves and do not pay the poverty - stricken their due ) .
And you love wealth and riches inordinately .
Assuredly , when the earth will be cleft asunder and crushed to dust particles .
And your Lord will unveil His Light and the angels will appear ( before His Presence ) rank upon rank .
And that Day Hell will be brought forth . On that Day man will come to understand , but how will admonition ( avail him then ) ?
He will say : Would that I had sent ( something ) ahead of me for my ( real ) life ( which would have helped me today ) !
But that Day no one will be able to torment like His torment .
And no one will be able to bind as He binds .
O contented ( pleased ) self !
Return to your Lord in such a state that you are both the aspirant to and the aspired of His pleasure ( i . e . you seek His pleasure and He seeks yours ) .
So join My ( perfect ) servants .
And enter Paradise ( of my nearness and sight ) .
I swear by this city ( Makka ) .
( O My Esteemed Beloved , ) because you are residing in it .
( O My Esteemed Beloved ! ) By ( your ) father ( Adam or Ibrahim [ Abraham ] ) and by those who are born .
Indeed We have created man ( ever suffering ) in rigours .
Does he think that no one can ever overpower him ?
( Boasting , ) he says : I have spent heaps of wealth .
Does he think that no one has seen him ( making this extravagant spending ) ?
Have We not made for him two eyes ?
And ( have We not given him ) a tongue and two lips ?
And ( have We also not ) shown him the two highways ( of good and evil ) ?
But he has not yet attempted the steep ascent ( of Din [ Religion ] ) of Truth and practical life dedicated to good and piety ) .
And what have you thought of the steep ascent ( of the rigours of the Din [ Religion ] of Truth ) ?
It is freeing a neck ( from slavery and subjugation ) .
Or feeding on a day of scarcity ( the poor and the needy during famine and scarcity i . e . striving to put an end to their sufferings and economic deadlock ) .
